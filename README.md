# CS360-MobileArchProg in Java
This app required 2 SQLite databases, one for users and one for inventory.  It also required a login page, ways to add, edit, and delete items int the inventory.  Lastly, it required to ask and implement permissions to notify the user if an item went to 0. 
The screens included a login/register screen, an inventory screen, an edit screen, and an add screen.  Hte designs were simple and not confusing for the user. 
I couldn't make my app work, my activites weren't working properly.
Testing was done in the Android Studio emulator and my own phone.
